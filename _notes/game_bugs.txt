- if hero has picked up an artifact on A7.vmap, game crashes on battle start
- makeHeal can target ballista, although UI does not allow to heal it
- enemy mines are invisible, but their location is compromised by a
  brief stop + a weird animation whenever one of their units passes through it
- mapeditor does not detect changes if only army is modified
- mapeditor does not remove creatures from army if they are set to "", but the count is >0
- mapeditor army window keyboard navigation (tab) is messed up
- summoning water elementals on A7.vmap if hero has 3 war machines causes an error
- summoning demons prevents summon elementals
- summoning elements causes random creature "cast" animation (manticores)
  (i believe same applies to all spells)
